    {"quote":"The most popular typefaces are the easiest to read; their popularity has made them disappear from conscious cognition. It becomes impossible to tell if they are easy to read because they are commonly used, or if they are commonly used because they are easy to read.", "author":"Zuzana Licko"},
    {"quote":"Any good typeface can be completely destroyed when misused or extensively overused. Helvetica seemed to sustain a beating like no other. <br><br>Still fresh, still popular, <br>Helvetica is king.", "author":"Alexander Gelman"},
